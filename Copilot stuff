Meeting Notes:

Initially, the controller was faulty. The second controller worked, but the phasing did not function correctly according to Dave Cameron. This issue seems to be resolved now, but we still need to configure it to ensure it works properly.
Another problem is that the new inverter is not working, although the old rack-mounted inverter is still operational.
We require support from a certified Alpha tech. Brian Rourke is not certified.
The same company (American Power) that installed the batteries at ASP is not certified on the Alpha product.
Anthony believes this might be a system issue rather than a parts issue.
Should we engage NorCal Batteries, the company that installed batteries at Pleasant Valley, for troubleshooting?
Dan from American Power worked with Alpha at Corcoran despite not being certified. Maybe we should talk to Alpha again to see if this can be applied to Avenal.
Takeaways:

David to call Alpha to see if they can work with American Power (Dan) to offer support, overlooking the "Alpha certified" requirement.
David to contact NorCal Batteries over the phone for next steps.
If step 1 doesn't resolve the issue, a certified Alpha tech should be sent to the site.
Follow up with David by the end of next week.
